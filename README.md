<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A dominating set in a weighted graph is a set of vertices such that every vertex outside the set is adjacent to a vertex in the set, and the sum of edge weights incident to the set for every vertex is at least K. The domination number is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set in the graph. The problem of finding the minimum dominating set is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been proved to be N P-hard. Given the difficulty of this problem, an algorithm is proposed for its solution and it is compared to the solution given by an exact algorithm and by the state-of-art algorithms. Computational results show that the proposal is able to find optimal or near-optimal solutions within a short computational time.
